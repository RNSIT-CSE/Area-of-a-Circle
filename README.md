## The Challenge: Calculating the Area of a Circle

Get ready for a geometric adventure! In this programming challenge, you'll be creating a C program that calculates the area of a circle.

Understanding the Problem

**Circles:** Circles are flat, round shapes where all the points on the edge are the same distance away from the center.

**Radius:** The radius is the distance from the center of a circle to its edge. It's the key piece of information you'll need.

**Area:** The area is the amount of space a circle occupies.

**Pi:** This is a special mathematical number (approximately 3.14159) used in circle calculations.

## Your Program: Input and Output

**Input:** Your program will need to take one piece of information from the user: the radius of the circle.
**Output:** After calculating, your program should neatly display the area of the circle.

Hints & Things to Remember

**Formula:** The area of a circle is calculated using the following formula:
 area = pi * radius * radius
**Units:** Make sure to specify the units of measurement for both the radius (e.g., centimeters, inches) and the resulting area (e.g., square centimeters, square inches).
